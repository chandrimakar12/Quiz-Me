# Design of a Learning Platform using Web Technology - Quiz Me


This project is only a Self-learning platform without a commercial use. Due to pandemic, learning has become more of an online activity rather than an offline one. This platform will be of great help for the students as they will be able to track their own learning and students of all age will be able to use the platform. And based on the features of the platform, it can be said that this will remain helpful to the students in post-pandemic situation also.
